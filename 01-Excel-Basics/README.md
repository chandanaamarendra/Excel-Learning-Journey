## 1. Excel Interface (Ribbon, Sheets, Rows, Columns)

Excel organizes data into a structured grid system consisting of rows and columns. Each intersection of a row and column is called a cell, where data is entered and processed.

The **Ribbon** contains all major tools such as formatting, formulas, sorting, filtering, and data management options. Understanding where tools are located improves speed and workflow efficiency.

Worksheets allow data to be organized across multiple tabs within the same workbook.

### Key Understanding

- Rows are numbered (1, 2, 3…)
- Columns are labeled alphabetically (A, B, C…)
- A cell reference is identified by column letter + row number (e.g., A1)
- The Ribbon provides quick access to Excel functionalities

Understanding the interface reduces hesitation and improves productivity while working with datasets.

## 2. Data Types (Text, Number, Date, Currency, Percentage)

Excel supports multiple data types, which determine how values are stored, displayed, and calculated.

- **Text** – Used for names, labels, and non-numeric entries.
- **Number** – Used for calculations.
- **Date** – Stored as serial numbers but displayed in date format.
- **Currency** – Used for financial values (₹, $, etc.).
- **Percentage** – Represents proportional values (e.g., 18%).

Proper data formatting ensures accurate calculations and professional reporting.
## 3. Cell Referencing (Relative, Absolute, Mixed)

Cell referencing determines how a formula behaves when copied or dragged across cells.

- **Relative Reference (A1)** – Changes automatically when dragged.
- **Absolute Reference ($A$1)** – Remains fixed.
- **Mixed Reference ($A1 or A$1)** – Fixes either the row or the column.

The **F4 key** is used to quickly toggle between reference types.

Understanding referencing is essential for building accurate calculations, especially when working with constants like tax rates or fixed values.

## 4. Basic Formulas (+, -, *, /)

Basic arithmetic formulas form the foundation of all Excel calculations.

- **Addition (+)** – Used to add values.
- **Subtraction (-)** – Used to find differences.
- **Multiplication (*)** – Used to calculate totals (e.g., Quantity × Price).
- **Division (/)** – Used to calculate ratios or averages.

Example used in practice:
Total_Amount = Quantity × Price

Basic formulas help build logical understanding before moving to advanced functions.

## 5. AutoFill & Flash Fill

### AutoFill

AutoFill allows formulas or values to be copied quickly across multiple cells by dragging the fill handle.

Shortcuts:
- **Ctrl + D** → Fill down
- **Ctrl + R** → Fill right

AutoFill improves speed and ensures consistency in calculations.

---

### Flash Fill

Flash Fill automatically detects patterns and fills data accordingly.

Shortcut:
- **Ctrl + E**

It is useful for extracting names, numbers, or structured patterns from text data.

Flash Fill works based on pattern recognition, not formulas.
## 6. Formatting (Font, Alignment, Borders, Colors)

Formatting improves readability and makes data visually structured.

Key formatting practices used:

- **Bold headers** for clarity
- **Borders** to define table structure
- **Currency format** for price values
- **Percentage format** for tax rate
- **Alignment adjustments** for clean presentation
- **Freeze Top Row** to keep headers visible

Shortcut used frequently:
- **Ctrl + 1** → Opens Format Cells dialog

Proper formatting enhances professionalism and reduces interpretation errors in reports.
## 7. Sorting & Filtering

Sorting and filtering help analyze and organize data without modifying the original dataset.

### Sorting
Sorting arranges data in ascending or descending order based on selected columns.

Practiced:
- Sorting by Price (High to Low)
- Custom sorting by multiple columns (e.g., Region → Product)

Shortcut:
- **Alt + A + S + A** → Sort A to Z
- **Alt + A + S + D** → Sort Z to A

---

### Filtering
Filtering allows viewing specific data based on conditions.

Practiced:
- Filtering by Region
- Filtering Quantity > 2
- Clearing filters

Shortcut:
- **Alt + A + T** → Toggle Filter
## 8. Freeze Panes

Freeze Panes keeps important rows or columns visible while scrolling through large datasets.

Key understanding:
- Excel freezes everything **above and to the left** of the selected cell.
- Commonly used to keep header rows visible.

Practiced:
- Freeze Top Row
- Custom Freeze (Row 1 + Column A)

Shortcut:
- **Alt + W + F + F** → Freeze Panes
## 9. Find & Replace

Find & Replace helps quickly locate or modify specific data across a worksheet.

Practiced:
- Replacing product names
- Using Find to locate specific entries
- Exploring Go To Special for blanks and formulas

Shortcuts:
- **Ctrl + F** → Find
- **Ctrl + H** → Replace
- **Ctrl + G** → Go To
