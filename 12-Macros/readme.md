# Excel Macro Automation for Hospital Data Cleaning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Excel Macros can automate repetitive data cleaning and formatting tasks. The macro automatically formats large hospital patient datasets in a single click, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

This project simulates a real-world Data Analyst workflow where datasets must be cleaned before analysis.

## What is a Macro in Excel?

A Macro is a recorded sequence of actions that Excel can replay automatically. It helps automate repetitive tasks such as formatting, cleaning, and organizing data.

Macros are created using Excel’s built-in Macro Recorder and stored using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications).

Benefits of Macros:

- Automates repetitive tasks
- Saves time
- Improves productivity
- Reduces manual errors
- Ensures consistent formatting

---

## Why Macros are Important for Data Analysts

Data Analysts frequently work with large datasets requiring repetitive formatting and cleaning.

Macros help automate tasks such as:

- Data formatting
- Report preparation
- Financial formatting
- Highlighting important values
- Preparing datasets for analysis

Macros improve workflow efficiency significantly.

## Dataset Description

This project uses a simulated hospital patient dataset containing 100 records.

Dataset fields:

- Patient_ID
- Patient_Name
- Age
- Gender
- Diagnosis
- Bill_Amount

This represents real-world healthcare analytics data.

---

## Tasks Automated Using Macro

The macro performs the following operations automatically:

### 1. Header Formatting
- Makes header bold
- Improves readability

### 2. Applying Borders
- Adds borders to entire dataset
- Improves structure

### 3. AutoFit Column Width
- Adjusts column width automatically
- Ensures proper data visibility

### 4. Currency Formatting
- Formats Bill_Amount column as currency
- Improves financial data clarity

### 5. Conditional Formatting
- Highlights bill amounts greater than 5000
- Helps identify high-value records

## Macro Recording Process

Steps followed to create the macro:

1. Open Developer Tab
2. Click Record Macro
3. Perform formatting actions
4. Stop Recording
5. Assign Macro to Button
6. Save file as .xlsm

This enables one-click automation.

---

## Absolute vs Relative Macros

### Absolute Macro
Works on fixed cell positions.

Example:
Always formats Row 1 header regardless of selected cell.

Use case:
Fixed dataset structure.

---

### Relative Macro
Works based on selected cell position.

Example:
Formats selected dataset dynamically.

Use case:
Flexible dataset positions.

---

## Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm)

Macros must be saved in Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook format:
**.xlsm**


Standard Excel format `.xlsx` does not support macros.

---

## How to Run the Macro

Steps:

1. Open Excel file (.xlsm)

2. Click "Clean Hospital Data" button

OR

Go to:

- Developer → Macros → Run Macro

### Benefits of Automation

Manual Process Time: 10–15 minutes
Automated Process Time: Less than 5 seconds

Efficiency Improvement: 95%

**Benefits:**

- Faster data preparation

- Reduced manual effort

- Consistent formatting

- Increased productivity
