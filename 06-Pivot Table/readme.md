# Sales Performance Dashboard using Excel

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw transactional sales data into meaningful business insights using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and interactive Dashboard features.

The dashboard enables quick analysis of sales performance across different regions, products, and salespersons, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.

This project simulates a real-world business reporting scenario commonly used by Data Analysts, MIS Executives, and Business Analysts.

## Business Problem

Organizations generate large volumes of sales data daily. However, raw data alone cannot provide clear insights. Businesses need structured reports and dashboards to answer key questions such as:

- Which region generates the highest revenue?
- Which product performs best?
- Which salesperson contributes the most?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- What percentage of total revenue comes from each region?

This dashboard solves these problems by providing an interactive and automated reporting solution.

- Date – Transaction date
- Region – Sales region (North, South, East, West)
- Product – Product category (Laptop, Mobile, Tablet)

- Units – Number of units sold
- Revenue – Total sales revenue generated

The dataset simulates real-world sales transactions across multiple regions and time periods.
